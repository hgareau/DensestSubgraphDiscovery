Thesis Outline


Chapter 1 - Introduction:
   Densest Subgraph Discovery Problem
   GPU and CUDA
   Goal and Purpose of Study

Chapter 2 - Existing Solutions:
   Golberg's
   Charikar's
   (maybe submodular)
   Greedy Peeling Algorithm
   Greedy++
   Intro to CoreExact

Possibly could split into "DSD solutions" and "related solutions"?

Chapter 3 - The CoreExact Algorithm:
   Motifs (don't know exactly when to cover this one)
   Adjacency Lists and Matrices
   Core Decomposition
   Flow Network and Min st-cut
   Golberg's Flow Network
   Exact Algorithm (Golberg's Max Flow Algorithm)
   Peeling/Pruning Methodology

Chapter 4 - Our Parallelized Implementation
Chapter 5 - Experimentation and Evaluation
Chapter 6 - Conclusion
