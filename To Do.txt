This is just a list of things to keep in mind going forward:

- Need to gather and put together visuals.
	(note: visuals for building the CoreExact algorithm likely smart)

- Need to go more in depth as to how the Flow Network and Min st-cut loop finds the densest subgraph.

- Need to go more in depth on the bounding (u - l >= certain value)

- Probably need more sources, especially to back up certain claims.

- Need to revisit each section for clarity.

- Need to add Implementation and onward after program is complete.
