This is just a list of things to keep in mind going forward:

- Start reading and understanding CUDA code, so I can write about the parallelized implementations. (use ChatGPT to understand if needed)

- Maybe need to go into densest kcore building/pruning. This would be both in Chapter 4 and Chapter 3.

- Explore adding additional sources for certain claims.

- Explore adding additional figures.

- Implement dynamic List of Tables if using them.

- Need to revisit each section for clarity.

- Need to add Implementation and onward after program is complete.

- Fill in highlighted sections.

- Make sure all Chapters and subsections are covered in the Table of Contents.

- Update List of Figures and Tables.

Maybe Do:

- Links that jump to page in Table of Contents
