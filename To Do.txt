This is just a list of things to keep in mind going forward:

- Start reading and understanding CUDA code, so I can write about the parallelized implementations. (use ChatGPT to understand if needed)

- Run experiments.

- Include coverage of the random graph generating code.

- Finish combing through Guo comments.

- Do I need to cover how clique data is stored between components and "clique nodes"? It's a potentially notable structure change.

- Make sure all references to Figures use the correct number.

- Update table of contents.

- Explore adding additional sources for certain claims.

- Explore adding additional figures.

- Implement dynamic List of Tables if using them.

- Need to revisit each section for clarity.

- Fill in highlighted sections.

- Make sure all Chapters and subsections are covered in the Table of Contents.

- Update List of Figures and Tables.

- Refer to Jenn Tharp notes (stored in repository)

Maybe Do:

- Links that jump to page in Table of Contents
