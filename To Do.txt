This is just a list of things to keep in mind going forward:

- Need to gather and put together visuals.
	(note: visuals for building the CoreExact algorithm likely smart)

- Replace the 2 highlighted "Existing Solutions" with Related Works from the CoreExact paper

- Need to go more in depth as to how the Flow Network and Min st-cut loop finds the densest subgraph. (maybe include math here)

- Need to go more in depth on the bounding (u - l >= certain value) (maybe include math here)

- Probably need more sources, especially to back up certain claims.

- Need to revisit each section for clarity.

- Need to add Implementation and onward after program is complete.

- Fill in highlighted sections.

- Restructure Table of Contents to include all subsections

- Add references page (can be done automatically through Word using the "Bibliography" tool under the References tab of Word).

Maybe Do:

- Links that jump to page in Table of Contents
