This is just a list of things to keep in mind going forward:

- Need to gather and put together visuals.
	(maybe include visuals for CoreExact and maybe Goldberg's algorithm)

- Explore adding additional sources for certain claims.

- Need to revisit each section for clarity.

- Need to add Implementation and onward after program is complete.

- Fill in highlighted sections.

- Restructure Table of Contents to include all subsections

- Fill in List of Figures and Tables.

- Add references page (can be done automatically through Word using the "Bibliography" tool under the References tab of Word).

Maybe Do:

- Links that jump to page in Table of Contents
