This is just a list of things to keep in mind going forward:

- Need to gather and put together visuals.
	(note: visuals for building the CoreExact algorithm likely smart)

- Cover how min st-cut gets subgraphs and how the u - l bounding works (if math is covered is tbd)

- Explore adding additional sources for certain claims.

- Need to revisit each section for clarity.

- Need to add Implementation and onward after program is complete.

- Fill in highlighted sections.

- Restructure Table of Contents to include all subsections

- Fill in List of Figures and Tables.

- Add references page (can be done automatically through Word using the "Bibliography" tool under the References tab of Word).

Maybe Do:

- Links that jump to page in Table of Contents
